                Tinkerhub is a people first community. The goal of Tinkerhub in campus is to help you, our fellow
                campus community members to learn 21<sup>st</sup> century technology and grab the opportunites
                provided by the same. We are not recommending any hierarchical structure for leading the campus
                community.
                <br><br>
                Even though, for every community there will be a set of founders, leades who trigger the vision.
                Second step is to find your team. Here are some guidelines for finding the team.
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>
                        Find people with interest in putting effort to learn of technology, share knowledge
                        and help others.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Talk to them about tinkerhub, how building a chapter will make an impact, what you are 
                        planning to do.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Listen to their vision and ensure that this align with yours.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        People who are already a member of a lot of communities are not 
                        encouraged to be in the lead team. Leads should be able to spend 
                        reasonable time in conducting Tinkerhub chapter operations.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Recognise and avoid people who join the community just for reputation 
                        or filing their resume.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                A virtual space for the community members to gather is common for every communities. 
                And it is a really helpful part for a community. Here you can share and obtain learning
                resources/opportunities, have great discussions about new technology trends and more over 
                you will have a set of great minds to help you to fix a bug or give an expert suggestion.
                Create your Tinkerhub community virtual space using any of the existing chat platforms like
                whatsapp, telegram, slack..etc. You can choose the platform based on a student survey or metrics 
                like number of students you are expected to join..etc.

                Use Tinkerhub logo and the name Tinkerhub- &lt;college name&gt; as the group name.

                Here are some tips for a better community virtual space experience from our pros.
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Add members to the group after proper filtering i.e add someone only if you find he has 
                        genuine interest in learning technology or building something.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Strictly discourage personal chitchats and contents other than the ones mentioned above 
                        (eg: political view contents, spams, techfest. promotions)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ensure privacy of group members.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                This is important. Because the community chapter is for building a learning culture in your campus. 
                So it’s one of your goal to inform the campus about the community activities and thereby attract more 
                innovators in you campus to the community. This can be effectively done via various social medias.
                <br><br>
                Here are some of the possibilities.
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Start a website with a forum, photos, videos about the work done by the community.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Start Facebook, twitter, instagram handles and update about the activities done by the chapter.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Posting stories of learning and achievements by students will help them achieve great 
                        reputation and it will bring more leaders to your endeavor.

        One of the key focus of Tinkerhub campus chapters, as mentioned many times in the handbook is to create a 
        self learning and peer learning culture in campus. We want students to learn technology that is not 
        available in the syllabus but needed by the industry. Tinkerhub promotes events that align with the above 
        philosophy.
        <br><br>
        Another key focus is to ensure that activities are conducted frequently and impacts are made in an energetic 
        manner. A problem many campuses facing is the issues in authority-student communication for conducting the 
        events. Tinkerhub would like you to do lead the community in your campus with minimum faculty intervention. 
        Though we always encourage passionate faculties to be part of the community.
        <br><br>
        Following are some of the events that can be conducted in a campus without much authority intervention. 
        We are excited to know about more similar event ideas you are going to experiment in your campus.

                Each person can select a topic and should give a 15 minute talk during the gathering. This event is
